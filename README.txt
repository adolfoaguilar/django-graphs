Dev revision. Please visit http://code.google.com/p/django-graphs/ for 
more information. Changes will be made to the majority of the modules herein,
and the interfaces provided in these files should not be construed as final.

There is some demo implementation code hidden in src/numbers_example.py -- it
should give you an idea of what the final implementation will look like.

Happy Hunting.
